Components
Components are basically classes that interact with the . html file of the component, which gets displayed on the browser.
Just-in-Time (JIT), which compiles your app in the browser at runtime. This was the default until Angular 8.
Ahead-of-Time (AOT), which compiles your app and libraries at build time. This is the default since Angular 9.

Pipes
Pipes are a useful feature in Angular. to transform values in an Angular template.and combine multiple functions into a single function. The pipe() function takes as its arguments the functions you want to combine, and returns a new function that, when executed, runs the composed functions in sequence.
Steps Involved In Creating a Custom Pipe In Angular are:
1) Create a Pipe Class and decorate it with the decorator @Pipe.
2) Supply a name property to be used as template code name.
3) Register your Pipe in the module under declarations.
4) Finally, implement PipeTransform and write transformation logic.
5) Use your pipe in the HTML using ‘|’, which represents a pipe.
6) Also, add Custom arguments if you want to.
